description: Panel on GraphQL Public APIs @ GraphQL Summit
---

Last month I was part of a panel on public GraphQL APIs during the GraphQL Summit.

[They've just released the recordings so you can now check it out!][link] There's a few
cool tips in there I learnt from my times building GraphQL APIs at both Shopify
and GitHub :)

Hope you enjoy! As always, you can find me on Twitter [@\_\_xuorig\_\_][twit] or [Github][xuo]
